    "overview": "The Goliath is based on lessons that were learned from the Scorpion.",
    "capabilities": "The Goliath is armed with what would be considered a paltry armament for a 'Mech of its size.",
    "deployment": "The 3067 2H is a Periphery upgrade of the 1H model. The 'Mech removes the Machine Guns from the chassis and adds in their place six Rocket Launcher 10s. This gives the Goliath a very powerful close range punch.",
    "history": "The Goliath is the second 'Mech built in 2652 by Brigadier Corporation. The first and most important difference is that the Goliath weighs in at 80 tons allowing it to carry a much heavier weapons payload and armor at the cost of mobility. The Goliath is used as a general assault 'Mech and until recently was not usually seen in large numbers because of the bias against quad 'Mechs prior to the 3060s. In the late 3060s the Goliath saw renewed production and renewed popularity and has since become a powerful and respected assault 'Mech. In 3143, The Corean Enterprises - MacAdams-Suharno plant on Stewart was captured by Clan Wolf, and it's GOL-6M variant production line converted to produce a Clan version of the 'Mech."
