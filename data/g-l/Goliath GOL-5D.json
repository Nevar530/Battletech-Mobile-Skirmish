    "overview": "The Goliath is used as a general assault 'Mech and until recently was not usually seen in large numbers because of the bias against quad 'Mechs prior to the 3060s.",
    "capabilities": "The Goliath is armed with what would be considered a paltry armament for a 'Mech of its size.",
    "deployment": "The 5D uses some of the newest technology available to the Federated Suns in 3067. The 'Mech is built based on the rugged older 1H chassis and standard engine. The 'Mech carries as its primary weapon a Rotary Autocannon/5. This is backed up by four ER Medium Lasers and two Machine Guns. The lasers and autocannon are all linked to an advanced Targeting Computer which gives the Goliath deadly accuracy at long ranges.",
    "history": "The Goliath is the second 'Mech built in 2652 by Brigadier Corporation. The Goliath is based on lessons that were learned from the Scorpion. The first and most important difference is that the Goliath weighs in at 80 tons allowing it to carry a much heavier weapons payload and armor at the cost of mobility. In the late 3060s the Goliath saw renewed production and renewed popularity and has since become a powerful and respected assault 'Mech. In 3143, The Corean Enterprises - MacAdams-Suharno plant on Stewart was captured by Clan Wolf, and it's GOL-6M variant production line converted to produce a Clan version of the 'Mech."
