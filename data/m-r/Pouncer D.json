  "text": {
    "overview": "The Pouncer was originally a testbed design that was upgraded to combat specifications on the orders of then ilKhan Ulric Kerensky, as it was realized that a more mobile 'Mech was needed when combating Inner Sphere forces.",
    "capabilities": "Overall, the Pouncer is an excellent OmniMech with 15.5 tons of pod space, allowing it to carry a wide variety of weapons payloads.",
    "deployment": "A close combat configuration, the Pouncer D carries six ER medium lasers for its primary firepower, which are linked to an advanced targeting computer for increased accuracy. The 'Mech also has two highly accurate Streak SRM-6 launchers which can eviscerate a target at close range. For protection from rear attacks, the 'Mech has a single ER small laser.",
    "history": "The Pouncer is built on a lightweight DSAM Endo 4 endo steel chassis and is powered by a 240-rated XL engine which gives it a maximum speed of 97.2 km/h. The 'Mech's mobility is enhanced with five Grandthrust Mk. Four jump jets that allow it to jump up to 150 meters. For protection from enemy fire, the Pouncer has a respectable six tons of Forging ZM15 ferro-fibrous armor. The last of the Nova factories on Tokasha were later retooled to create Pouncers after the Wars of Reaving."
