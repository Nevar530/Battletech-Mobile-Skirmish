    "overview": "The Ostscout was designed as a pure recon BattleMech by Ostmann Industries. To that end, it was built entirely around gathering data and getting out of trouble, tasks for which it is exceptional.",
    "capabilities": "The Ostscout is quick enough to escape most traps, and very few other designs can match it in terms of speed and maneuverability. However its ability to run and leap out of danger came at the expense of offensive capability. In fact were it not for aggressive lobbying on the part of its test pilots the final production model would have been completely weaponless. As it is, the Ostscout would be hard-pressed to win a fight against all but the lightest 'Mechs. A poor combatant, the 'Mech excels at operating deep behind enemy lines, gathering as much information as possible about the terrain and the disposition of enemy forces. The true centerpiece of the design is its advanced sensor systems, including the TRSS.2L3 target-tracking system and powerful narrow-band Barret 4000 comm system. The sensor arrays themselves are mounted outside the main chassis due to their delicate nature, with the Ostscout using its arms to aim them. Everything from hydrological to geological data is recorded, so much data in fact that the 'Mech's computer cannot process it fast enough. This forces the Ostscout to move slowly when traveling through an area of interest, waving its arms seemingly at random, which makes it one of the few times the 'Mech is vulnerable to the enemy. However so long as the enemy's first salvo doesn't cripple it, the Ostscout will likely escape from an ambush.",
    "deployment": "Produced by Krupp Armament Works, the 10CS Ostscout saves weight through the use of an XL Engine and an XL Gyro, which gives up durability for more combat payload weight, allowing the 'Mech to jump up to 300 meters through the use of ten Rawlings 45i Improved Jump Jets. The 10CS carries an improved C3 computer to communicate with similarly equipped units and carries two Diverse Optics ER Medium Lasers for defensive combat capabilities.",
    "history": "Starting in 2600 Ostmann built and sold the Ostscout to fulfill many armies' need for a swift reconnaissance 'Mech, but eventually found that demand was outstripping their production ability. Rather than sacrifice their popular Ostroc line of urban-combat 'Mechs, the company licensed Kong Interstellar to start building the 'Mech in 2700, an arrangement similar to that struck regarding the Ostsol. Kong would continue to build Ostscouts for the next hundred years until the destruction of their factory on Connaught at the outset of the Succession Wars. Deprived of the possibility of replacement, many commanders began to hoard their Ostscouts like valuable treasure, parceling them out only for special missions. Most Ostscout pilots would not even attempt to engage enemy 'Mechs, as the advanced sensor system became extremely rare and nearly impossible to replace. This unwillingness to put the 'Mech in danger meant many survived the Succession Wars in practically mint condition, although many which suffered damage to their advanced sensors were forced to replace them with inferior, albeit more robust, systems. Besides the Great Houses, ComStar also utilized the Ostscout, and in the aftermath of the Clan Invasion and ComStar Schism began developing a new Ostscout variant for their Com Guards. This new model would maintain the same maneuverability and intelligence-gathering capabilities of the original while improving its offensive and defensive capabilities. Debuting with success in 3064, within the next three years nearly half of all Com Guard Ostscouts had been upgraded to the new variant; however it was soon discovered that both the Lyran Alliance and Word of Blake were fielding their own updated Ostscouts identical to ComStar's. The intelligence leak would be confirmed and traced back to Dag Kesselring, former Precentor of the 66th Division, who passed on information about the program to both the Lyrans and Blakists. Used by both sides in the Blakist Jihad, the newborn Republic of the Sphere would maintain production of the 11J model Ostscout after the fall of Terra both for its own relatively limited needs as well as export sales to the Federated Suns and Lyran Commonwealth. Still produced during the Dark Age era, aside from the Krupp plant's combat focused Phoenix models both Kong Interstellar and Robinson Standard BattleWorks reintroduced variants that lean more heavily towards the original look and recon aspects of the venerable 7J model."
