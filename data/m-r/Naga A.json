    "overview": "The Naga BattleMech, named for its resemblance to a mythological cobra, stands as an unusual design in a culture that values personal glory and ritual combat. Originating from Clan Wolf, the Naga was developed from a modified Woodsman chassis, equipped to carry a pair of Arrow IV launchers. Despite initial skepticism due to its focus on indirect fire support rather than direct combat, the Naga quickly demonstrated its strategic value on the battlefield.",
    "capabilities": "The primary role of the Naga is to provide sustained artillery support while maintaining a degree of mobility. Its standard configuration emphasizes this role, equipped with six tons of missile ammunition but minimal short-range defense.",
    "deployment": "The Naga A is a Clan-configured 80-ton OmniMech, functioning predominantly as a missile boat with an emphasis on ranged artillery support. Built upon a durable Clan Endo Steel structure and powered by a 400 XL (Clan) Engine, this variant of the Naga series balances firepower with mobility, characteristic of Clan technology.<p>Like its Prime variant, the Naga A is equipped with two Arrow IV launchers in its torso, enabling it to deliver effective long-range missile barrages. In addition to its primary artillery armament, this variant enhances its close-range combat capabilities with two ER Medium Lasers and an ER Small Laser. This combination of lasers provides a significant upgrade in close-quarter defense, compensating for the lack of armaments and ensuring the Naga A can hold its own in more varied combat scenarios. The Naga A is a versatile artillery platform, suitable for a wide range of tactical applications where both long-range bombardment and close-quarters defense are essential.</p>",
    "history": "First deployed in the mid-2900s, the Naga's adoption across various Clans was gradual. Its effectiveness was convincingly demonstrated during the battle for Tukayyid, where Clan Wolf's Naga-equipped artillery Stars played a pivotal role. Notably, the Nagas were instrumental in Wolf’s victory at Brzo and Skupo, significantly weakening ComStar’s Tenth Army. This success led to its wider acceptance and deployment among several other Clans, including the Hell’s Horses, Snow Ravens, Star Adders, Cloud Cobras, and in limited numbers, the Jade Falcons."
