    "overview": "Developed by Team Banzai as the big brother of the highly successful Hatchetman, the Axman was designed exclusively to be a 'Mech killer",
    "capabilities": "The Axman has a ground speed of only 64.8 km/h, which is average for a Heavy weight, but improved in part by the inclusion of Jump Jets. The 'Mech is covered with eleven tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor that gives it a great deal of protection, with ten Double Heat Sinks offering average heat dissipation. Much like its lighter brother, the Axman was designed to utilize the Full-Head Ejection System to safe-guard its MechWarrior.",
    "deployment": "An attempt to reduce reliance upon foreign equipment, this exclusively Davion variant replaced the 1N line on New Syrtis in 3071. It drops the jump jets, lasers, and large-bore autocannon in favor of four Light Autocannon/5s, supplemented by two medium lasers. Two tons of ammunition stored in a CASE protected bay allows for some flexibility in the choice of munitions. A Targeting Computer improves the accuracy of all the weapons on the 'Mech. It uses Ferro-Fibrous armor for protection.",
    "history": "The Axman was also intended as a symbol of solidarity throughout the Federated Commonwealth by using components that were produced in Federated Suns, Lyran Commonwealth, and even former Capellan Confederation space. The collapse of the Federated Commonwealth in 3057 almost rendered the design extinct because of this, production slowing to a trickle as both the Federated Suns and Lyran Alliance were forced to rely on surplus stores while developing new variants utilizing locally sourced components."
