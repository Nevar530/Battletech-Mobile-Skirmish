    "deployment": "Like the J configuration, this version uses five Improved Jump Jets. It also has twenty double heat sinks. It's equipped with four Large Pulse Lasers, two Small Pulse Lasers, two Flamers, and an ER Medium Laser. It also has a Light TAG and Light Active Probe.",
    "history": "Following the development of Advanced Tactical Missile technology. The creation of the Savage Coyote was a direct result of both the warriors of Clan Coyote clamoring for new weapons to use and the election of Khan Sullivan Koga in 3052."
