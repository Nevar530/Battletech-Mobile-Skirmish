    "overview": "The Templar III is a Dark Age era Assault Class OmniMech, first produced by General Motors for the Federated Suns. It was intended as a replacement for the original Templar, whose factory lines were destroyed during the Jihad. General Motors established a new production line on New Valencia for what was to become the next generation of the Templar with newer technologies.",
    "capabilities": "Like its predecessor, the Templar III is typically utilized as a Command 'Mech by AFFS forces. With its alternate configurations the 'Mech is able to handle various combat situations thanks to access to Advanced equipment.",
    "deployment": "The second of the Templar III's advanced tech configurations, the C Configuration is armed with the following: a single Class 5 Rotary Autocannon, a pair of ER medium lasers, a Six-Tubed Streak SRM Launcher, an ER Small Laser, and a single Large Re-Engineered Laser. The autocannon is supplied with 3 tons of ammunition, while 1 ton of ammunition is allotted to the Streak Launcher.",
    "history": "Among the most noticeable differences when comparing the original Templar to the Templar III is its smaller Pod Capacity. The new 'Mech has a 29 ton Pod capacity in comparison to the old Templar's 40 tons. However, the 'Mech's heavier Light Engine provides improved durability while retaining the original design's maximum speed and armor protection."
