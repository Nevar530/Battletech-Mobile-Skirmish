    "overview": "The Starslayer was intended to replace the Crab as the Star League's standard medium 'Mech after Cosara Weaponries were unable to meet the SLDF's required production volumes.",
    "capabilities": "The Starslayer is built on a lightweight Thor-4 Endo Steel chassis and reaches a top speed of 86.4 km/h with its Magna 250 fusion engine. The Starslayer also has five Odin's Own Model 34z jump jets which give it the ability to jump up to one hundred and fifty meters. Finally, the design carries nine and a half tons of Norse-34 ferro-fibrous with CASE. The CASE protects the BattleMech from complete destruction in the event of an ammunition explosion.",
    "deployment": "The primary weapons on the Starslayer are a pair of BlazeFire Systems Large Lasers that provide the 'Mech with a striking distance of up to four hundred and fifty meters. For close range combat, the Starslayer has two Defiance B3M medium lasers and a Defiance B4M small laser. Finally, to allow the Starslayer to find and exploit weak points in an enemy's armor, it also carries a TharHes 4 Pack SRM-4 launcher. The FireScan T&T system of the 3C and 3D is imported from Richvale. Normally used on LRM and SRM Carriers, the system seem incompatible with laser weaponry until computer add-ons fixed the issue.",
    "history": "Though Blue Shot's design won selection in 2765, the Starslayer would also be plagued with technical delays with its tracking system that would delay full production until 2772 and the Amaris Civil War. Despite the SLDF's desperate need for matériel, tensions between General Kerensky and Archon Robert Steiner II would result in Blue Shot delaying SLDF shipments until 2781 due to lack of \"up-to-date\" shipping information and as a result the Starslayer would be far more common in the LCAF service than the SLDF. By now a thoroughly Lyran Commonwealth design, production of the original 2C Starslayer would cease during the technological decline of the early Succession Wars, with Blue Shot Weaponry resuming with the superior and updated STY-3C model in wake of the Clan Invasion."
