    "overview": "The Savage Coyote OmniMech was created as a showcase OmniMech. The 'Mech was also part of Khan Koga's attempts to revitalize the fading Clan that invented the OmniMech.",
    "capabilities": "This assault 'Mech uses an XL Engine to save enough weight to devote forty-five tons of space to modular equipment and fifteen tons of armor. The base chassis contains fourteen fixed double heat sinks.",
    "deployment": "This configuration focuses on long-range combat with an ER PPC, a pair of ER Large Lasers, and two ATM 9s that carry enough ammunition to be effective at all ranges. Three ER Medium Lasers provide medium to close range support, while a Targeting Computer aids the accuracy of all the energy weapons. Three jump jets give the 'Mech some extra maneuverability.",
    "history": "Following the development of Advanced Tactical Missile technology. The creation of the Savage Coyote was a direct result of both the warriors of Clan Coyote clamoring for new weapons to use and the election of Khan Sullivan Koga in 3052."
