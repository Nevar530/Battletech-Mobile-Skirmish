    "overview": "The Thunder Hawk, developed by Norse Technologies for the Amaris-Terran Hegemony invasion, became a staple in General Aleksandr Kerensky's forces. Surviving 'Mechs were taken into Exodus, symbolizing their significance. In the 3050s, Norse-Storm BattleMechs revived the Thunder Hawk among other Star League-era designs.",
    "capabilities": "Dominating the Thunder Hawk's arsenal are three Norse Gauss rifles, accounting for over half its weight. These long-range weapons can incapacitate most foes with a single barrage. Ammunition is distributed throughout the torso to mitigate critical damage risks. However, its Achilles' heel lies in the extra-light Vlar fusion engine. While heavily armored, any breach in the torso significantly compromises the BattleMechâ€™s structural integrity, rendering it inoperable.",
    "deployment": "The Thunder Hawk TDK-7Y variant represents a tactical shift from its predecessor, the TDK-7X. While it retains the core firepower of three Gauss Rifles, it makes a notable change in its secondary armament. The four standard Medium Lasers have been replaced with two Medium Pulse Lasers, one in each arm. This adjustment enhances the TDK-7Y's accuracy and improves its heat management capabilities, allowing it to maintain a more sustained rate of fire in combat scenarios.<p>However, this modification has met with mixed reactions among pilots. The reduced range and perceived decrease in overall firepower, compared to the more versatile standard Medium Lasers, have made the TDK-7Y less popular. Pilots often express a preference for the broader engagement options offered by the TDK-7X's laser configuration.</p><p>Powered by a 300 XL Engine, the TDK-7Y maintains the same mobility as its predecessor, with a top speed of 32.4 km/h. The use of a standard internal structure and single heat sinks, similar to the TDK-7X, presents the same challenges in terms of weight and heat management.</p><p>Despite these trade-offs, the TDK-7Y remains a formidable sniper 'Mech, especially in roles where precision and heat efficiency are prioritized over versatility. Its status as a command 'Mech and the difficulties in maintenance due to its complex systems and rare technology further position it as a specialized tool in the arsenal of an elite pilot.</p>",
    "history": "The Thunder Hawk became a hallmark of the Lyran Alliance, extensively utilized during the FedCom Civil War. Contrary to its design as a support 'Mech, Loyalists deployed it in direct combat, leveraging its heavy armor. Post-war, Archon Peter Steiner Davion allocated new Thunder Hawks to units loyal to Allied forces. Plans for export are pending until the completion of military restructuring."
